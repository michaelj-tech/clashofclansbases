        <h2>Role of Clash of Clans Layouts?</h2>
        <p>Upgrading your villages and using the best attacking strategies isn’t enough to dominate the game. Players
            must have the best arrangement of walls, perfect trap combinations, critical hero positioning,
            compartmentalization, and well-planned placement of defensive structures.</p>
        <p>Expertly designed Clash of Clans Bases always give the attackers a tough time and never let them earn more
            trophies, resources, and three or even two stars. Whether you want to protect your trophies, town hall/
            builder hall, or secure gold, elixir, and dark elixirs, you just need strategically designed coc layouts.
        </p>
        <p>We have a team of experienced Clash of Clans players who have been a part of this game for years and know
            all the offensive and defensive strategies. They design and provide a huge collection of farming, hybrid,
            war, clan war league, anti-air, anti-2 star, anti-3 star, anti-trophy, funny/troll, and many other defense
            bases.</p>

            <li>It must lead you to victory in multiplayer battles, wars, Clan War Leagues, and other challenges.</li>
            <li>It should secure the village base against various attacks including air attacks, ground attacks, and
                different troop combinations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 70px;">Clash of Clans Builder Hall Bases</h2>
        <p>The builder base is the master builder’s land far from the home village which is another most playable mode
            of the Clash of Clans. In builder base attacks “versus battle” players compete against each other in
            real-time. Just like the town hall, the builder hall also unlocks many new structures after upgrading.</p>
        <p>The builder base has separate buildings, troops, and defenses and requires the best designs for builder hall
            bases. Visit bases-coc and copy the best COC builder hall bases for any level from BH3 to the latest
            builder hall level BH10 with links. Defend your builder base against versus battles and protect your stars
            and trophies.</p>

    <!-- ==================== Types of Bases Section ==================== -->
    <section class="container">
        <h2>Types of Clash of Clans Bases</h2>
        <p>Attackers follow different attacking strategies to loot resources, collect trophies, and earn stars so
            players require strong defense against all the unique attacks. Some players want to protect the town hall,
            others want to secure resources, some focus on preventing attackers from getting trophies, and others show
            strength and reflect their offence.</p>
        <p>Our team provides you with a huge collection of war, farming, hybrid, trophy, anti-air, anti 2 star, anti 3
            star, defense, funny, art, progress, anti-loot, anti-ground, anti everything, and all other types of COC
            Bases.</p>

        <h3>Farming Bases</h3>
        <p>Farming bases are designed particularly to protect resources. We design the bases for players who focus on
            farm by placing gold, elixir, and dark elixir storages in the central compartments.</p>

        <h3>War/CWL Bases</h3>
        <p>War bases are designed to protect the Town Hall, especially in wars and CWL/Clan War Leagues. These bases
            are further categorized into anti 2 star and anti 3 star bases. Our team designs extremely hard bases to
            prevent the attackers from easily earning 2-star or 3-star victory.</p>

        <h3>Trophy Bases</h3>
        <p>Trophy bases never let the enemies earn more trophies and move up in leagues. This can be done by
            preventing the attackers from getting 50% destruction. We provide a wide range of anti trophy bases for all
            town halls.</p>

        <h3>Hybrid Bases</h3>
        <p>Focusing on resource protection and also preventing the high star victory needs combined features farm,
            trophy, and war bases. This is possible with hybrid base links and players can have a strong defense with
            hybrid layout designs.</p>

        <h3>Anti Air Bases</h3>
        <p>Bases designed specifically to defend the village against common offensive strategy, air attacks are known as
            anti-air bases. These are also known as anti-dragon, anti-electro, or anti-balloon bases. We offer an
            extensive collection of anti air bases for all TH levels.</p>

        <h3>Funny/Art Bases</h3>
        <p>Fun loving players usually use art/funny bases to showcase creativity, troll the attacker, and sometimes
            participate in Clash of Clans community events.</p>
        <p>We provide multiple base designs and also explain their defense working by adding videos for each layout
            design. We attack all our bases with strong army combinations and max level troops and spells to show the
            defensive strength. Our videos are the best demo for the players who do not understand the strategic depth
            and they can easily choose the best coc base layouts.</p>
